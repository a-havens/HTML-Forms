# HTML-Forms
For this assessment, you will get the opportunity to build an email form. You'll need to create the following fields:

Name
Email
Message
If you wish to add radio buttons, checkboxes, or a drop-down menu to include additional information, you are welcome to do so. Make sure that the web page with your form is hosted on GitHub, and publish it as a GitHub page. If you need a refresher on how to do this, review the GitHub introduction in the HTML and CSS fundamentals module or reach out to your peers. When you're done, submit a link to your solution work.
